# CHaks
WORK IN PROGRESS
only tested with a virtual machine Linux kali 5.14.0-kali4-amd64 (Host system windows 10)

Everything should work except FileInterceptor. Expect bugs.

NOTE: you will need libmnl and libnetfilter_queue installed.
You can install them with the following commands:


<code>sudo apt-get update</code>

<code>sudo apt-get install libmnl-dev</code>

<code>sudo apt-get install libnetfilter-queue-dev</code>

A more thorough documentation coming once the programs are more stable and/or when I manage to overcome my laziness.
