# CHaks
WORK IN PROGRESS
only tested with a virtual machine Linux kali 5.14.0-kali4-amd64 (Host system windows 10)

Everything should work except FileInterceptor. Expect bugs.

NOTE: you will need libmnl and libnetfilter_queue installed.
You can install them with the following commands:


<code>sudo apt-get update</code>

<code>sudo apt-get install libmnl-dev</code>

<code>sudo apt-get install libnetfilter-queue-dev</code>

NOTE: you will also need the PacketCraft library which can be found here: https://github.com/tuomok1010/PacketCraft
Instructions on how to link the PacketCraft library to CHaks coming sooner or later...
